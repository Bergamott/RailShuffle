			<h1>Introduction</h1>
			<p>The object of this game is to guide one or more mining carts along
			railway tracks to pick up bags of money. A level is completed
			when all the bags have been collected within the available
			amount of time.</p>
			<p><img src="bwcartbag.png" class="cartpic"></p>
			
            <p>If a cart runs off the tracks, it will stop. If it runs into an
            obstacle or falls into a hole, it will crash. The game is over if
            all carts have crashed or become immobilized.</p>
			
			<h1>How to Play</h1>
			<p><img src="bwexample1.png" align="right" class="example1">
			The playing field consists of a grid of blocks that can be
			moved around with the use of holes. Touching a block located next
			to a hole will move it in that direction. (If there is more than one
			hole next to a block, nudge it in the direction you want it to move.)</p>
			
			<p>This way you can rearrange the tracks to guide the carts into
			new paths or help them avoid crashing or falling into holes.</p>
			
			<p>Selecting <b>Play</b> in the main menu will take you to a level
			selection screen. With the exception of the first three, a level
			will only become accessible after you have successfully completed
			the one before it.</p>
			
			<h1>Scoring</h1>
			<p>Your performance will be graded as
			<b>OK</b>, <b>Good</b> or <b>Great</b>
			depending on how long it takes you to complete a level. A timer
			keeps counting down and if it runs out completely you will have
			failed.</p>
